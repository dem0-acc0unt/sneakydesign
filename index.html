    <h1>Sneaky Design</h1>
    <p>Sneaky design patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that hook you in continued use of their services, like scrolling through a feed or continually watching videos.</p>
    <h2>Endless scrolling</h2>
    <p>When the user is able to consume a lot of content easily, this is usually done by making the cost of consuming new content very low, for example, as simple as a swipe or click.</p>
    <p>The user may forget about their surroundings or the time, leading to realisations of hours being lost after being exposed to this design feature.</p>
    <h2>Highly visual</h2>
    <p>Design that takes advantage of being highly visual can be more rewarding to the user as humans are highly visual beings and hence it is a design pattern to be highly visual in nature.</p>
    <p>Due to visual design, users may get high rewards leading to dopamine hits and subsequent action.</p>
    <h2>User incentives</h2>
    <p>Designs such as  views and follower or subscriber numbers create social rewards for users to create content for others to consume. This is also increases user engagement. Other designs include likes.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>The algorithm</h2>
    <p>By using machine learning to recommend the content that you will most likely to consume, the user feels like they have no choice but to consume it as the cost of action is low but the reward can be high.</p>
    <h2>Novel content</h2>
